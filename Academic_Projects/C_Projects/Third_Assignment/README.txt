This was the final project of C programming class.
I designed a simple C program which analyses statistics of train travelers.

This program imports data from text files (locations.txt, passenger.txt), and then analyses the data.
And finally it exports the data of passengers and locations into detailed.txt file.
Current detailed.txt file is the result of this program.
